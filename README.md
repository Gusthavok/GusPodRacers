# GusPodRacers  

## Requirements :  
Python 3.11.8  
Tkinter 8.6  
Numpy 1.26.3  
  
Some bugs were reported on Linux environment, you should execute this code with windows.  
  
## Objectives :  
Getting strond podracers for MadPodRacing (a CodinGame challenge).  
Actually the algorithm is using natural selction, but a dqn version will sonn be released.  
  
## Running the algorithm :  
Run the file src/evolution.py  
Once you have trainned your models, you can comment line 469 and line 470, respectively training basic methods for attacks and training versus attack-defense and observe your models fighting in the game.
